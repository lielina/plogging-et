## Components

### Gallery Page (Gallery.tsx)

## Data Structure
The gallery uses a simple data structure for images:

interface GalleryItem {
  id: number;
  src: string;
  alt: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  date: string;
  location: string;

}
```

## Styling
Custom CSS is used to enhance the gallery experience:
